# tools
This repo contains various tools i've tailor-made.

Most of them are already available on the internet, but I just like to use my own tools instead of other's.

Those tools are miscelleanous scripts I made while being sysadmin or doing some reasearch. 
They're not meant to be the most beautiful nor bug-free neither stability, they just need to work (gruik)

Enjoy ! (September 2016)
